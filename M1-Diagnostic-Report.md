# Cardano Funding Ecosystem Assessment Report

## Analysis of Ecosystem Funding Mechanisms

**Report Date:** December 26, 2025  
**Version:** 2.5  
**Prepared By:** Consensus Consulting LLC  
**Report Type:** Ecosystem Funding Assessment with Stakeholder Mapping  
**Analysis Period:** September 2020 \- November 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This assessment analyzes Cardano's three funding mechanisms—Project Catalyst, BuilderDAO, and Intersect.

The summary is designed to provide a rapid understanding of the ecosystem's scale, effectiveness, and structural characteristics before engaging with the analysis in subsequent sections. All claims presented here are substantiated with inline citations to publicly verifiable sources, and detailed methodology is documented in the full report.

### Findings

**Ecosystem Scale:**

- Total Projects: 2,279 projects and programs  
- Weighted Completion Rate: \~75% across all mechanisms  
- Geographic Reach: 114+ countries, 75% Western concentration

**Financial Summary:**

| Mechanism | Source Currency | Source Amount | USD Equivalent | Conversion Method |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Catalyst F2-F9** | USD (actual) | $38,375,000 | $38,375,000 | No conversion (actual USD from source) |
| **Catalyst F10-F14** | ADA | ₳204,600,000 | $102,300,000 | ₳204.6M × $0.50/ADA |
| **BuilderDAO** | ADA | ₳12,000,000 | $7,960,320 | ₳12M × $0.66336/ADA |
| **Intersect 2025** | ADA | ₳264,000,000 | $132,000,000 | ₳264M × $0.50/ADA |
| **TOTAL** | Mixed | ₳480.6M \+ $38.4M | **\~$278.7M** | Combined actual \+ converted |

**ADA to USD Conversion Methodology:** USD equivalent figures use time-weighted average ADA prices during each fund's distribution period. Catalyst Funds 2-9 (USD-denominated) use actual USD amounts from official records. Catalyst Funds 10-14 (ADA-denominated) use $0.50/ADA average, reflecting the 2023-2024 price range of $0.25-$0.75. BuilderDAO uses $0.66336/ADA, reflecting the DAO's price peg mechanism which applied a 20% volatility buffer to the ADA price at proposal creation ($0.8292 × 0.8). Intersect uses $0.50/ADA for the 2025 budget year. These are approximations; actual USD value varies with ADA price volatility. Source data from [Catalyst Public Reporting Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/).

**Mechanism Performance:**

| Mechanism | Allocated | Projects | Approval Rate | Completion Rate | Avg Allocation | Primary Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Catalyst** | $140.7M (₳204.6M \+ $38.4M) | 2,222 | Varies by fund | 67.5% overall; 82% F2-F9 | $63,316 | Early-stage innovation |
| **BuilderDAO** | $6M (₳12M) | 20 funded (27 applied) | 74.1% (20/27) | Pending (in progress) | $138,534 | Growth-stage builders |
| **Intersect** | $132M (₳264M) | 37 programs | 94.9% (37/39) | 96% quarterly milestones | $3,567,568 | Core infrastructure |

**Key Findings and Considerations:**

1. **Coordination Gap:** No joint coordination body exists across the three mechanisms. BuilderDAO maintains unilateral rules referencing Catalyst (membership prerequisites, anti-double-dipping), but no bilateral or trilateral structure enables strategic alignment or systematic information sharing → Consider establishing ecosystem funding coordination committee  
2. **Data Sharing Gap:** No unified project database across mechanisms → Consider implementing unified project tracking system  
3. **Strategic Alignment Gap:** No ecosystem-wide funding strategy exists → Consider creating formal goal alignment framework  
4. **Geographic Concentration:** 75% of funding allocated to Western regions → Consider developing regional funding programs

### Analysis Framework

This assessment employs a six-dimension evaluation methodology applied consistently across all three funding mechanisms:

1. **Funds Disbursed:** Total allocated, distributed amounts, distribution timeline, payment structure  
2. **Mechanisms Used:** Voting systems, approval thresholds, governance processes, accountability structures  
3. **Results:** Participation metrics, approval rates, completion outcomes, project statistics  
4. **Critical Findings:** Data-driven observations about performance, challenges, and patterns  
5. **Innovations:** Novel governance mechanisms, payment structures, or accountability frameworks  
6. **Impact:** Measurable ecosystem outcomes, precedents established, lessons learned

### Data Sources

**Primary Sources:**

1. **Catalyst Public Reporting Tracker** [\[1\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/): Official data for all Catalyst proposals  
2. **BuilderDAO Governance Retrospective** [\[2\]](https://medium.com/@cardanobuilderdao/retrospective-governance-round-1-30fb9a30884c): Official Cycle 1 outcomes and data  
3. **1694.io Proposal \#226** [\[3\]](https://www.1694.io/proposals/226): BuilderDAO treasury allocation governance proposal  
4. **Intersect Budget Documentation** [\[4\]](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-budget-committee/archive/2025-cardano-budget-proposal-a-cardano-blockchain-ecosystem-budget): Official 2025 budget breakdown  
5. **Project Catalyst Official Website** [\[5\]](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds): Fund summaries and participation data  
6. **Intersect Official Website** [\[6\]](https://www.intersectmbo.org): Committee structure and governance documentation  
7. **BuilderDAO Official Website** [\[7\]](https://buildingoncardano.io/): Member list and governance processes

**Stakeholder Mapping Sources:**

- Official committee rosters and election results  
- Governance documentation from all three mechanisms  
- Public member lists and voting records  
- On-chain governance data from Cardano

### Data Quality and Limitations

**Strengths:**

- Project-level data for 2,222 Catalyst proposals  
- Official governance documentation from all three mechanisms  
- Verified stakeholder lists from public sources  
- Cross-referenced statistics from multiple sources

**Limitations:**

- 527 Catalyst projects lack final outcome data, concentrated in recent funds (F10-F14)  
- BuilderDAO Cycle 1 projects still in progress; completion outcomes pending  
- Geographic distribution data estimated from public project information  
- Intersect 2025 budget completion rate reflects Q1-Q3 milestones; Q4 data not available

**Geographic Distribution Methodology:**

Geographic distribution estimates vary by mechanism based on available data. Catalyst geographic data (Fund 2-9) derives from self-reported proposer locations in the Catalyst Public Reporting Tracker [\[1\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/). BuilderDAO and Intersect estimates derive from publicly available team location data on project and committee member profiles, carrying higher uncertainty than Catalyst's self-reported data.

**Completion Rate Calculation Methodology:**

Catalyst completion rates are calculated from projects with known outcomes only. Of 2,222 total Catalyst projects, 1,695 (76.3%) have verified outcome data, while 527 (23.7%) lack final reporting (this most likely due to some of those milestones still being in process or worked). The 67.5% overall completion rate represents 1,143 completed projects out of 1,695 with known outcomes. The 82% rate for Funds 2-9 and 51% rate for Funds 10-14 use the same methodology (completed/known outcomes). Projects without outcome data are excluded from completion rate calculations but noted separately as an accountability gap.

## Stakeholder Mapping

This section maps all stakeholder groups involved in Project Catalyst, BuilderDAO, and Intersect MBO, documenting their specific roles, decision-making authority, and participation levels. The mapping reveals structural differences between mechanisms: Catalyst operates through capital-weighted voting by a broad community, BuilderDAO employs one-member-one-vote governance among proven builders, and Intersect coordinates through specialized committees with elected representatives.

The stakeholder analysis serves multiple purposes. First, it provides transparency about who makes funding decisions and through what processes. Second, it enables identification of power concentration patterns that may affect funding outcomes. Third, it documents the verification status of claimed participants, distinguishing between publicly confirmed individuals and unverified claims. All stakeholder counts and role descriptions are drawn from official governance documents, public meeting records, and verifiable on-chain data, with evidence categories clearly indicated where verification is incomplete.

### Overview

Cardano's funding ecosystem involves multiple stakeholder groups across three distinct mechanisms. This section identifies all decision-makers, their roles, and their influence on funding outcomes.

**Note on Contact Information:** Individual contact information for stakeholders is maintained separately in governance records and public profiles linked in verification sources. For Project Catalyst stakeholders, contact information is available through official Catalyst platform profiles. For BuilderDAO members, contact information is accessible via project websites listed in Appendix A. For Intersect committee members, contact information is available through Intersect's official committee member pages referenced in verification sources.

### Project Catalyst Stakeholders

**Decision-Making Authority:**

| Stakeholder Group | Role | Decision Power | Count |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Voters** | Final funding decisions | Capital-weighted (1 ADA \= 1 vote) | 175K recent |
| **Community Reviewers** | Proposal assessment | Weighted scoring influence | 3,500+ |
| **Community Moderators** | Review quality control | Approve/reject flagged reviews | \~100-200 |
| **Proposers** | Submit funding requests | No direct decision power | 1,600+ |
| **Catalyst Team** | Platform administration | Process facilitation | \~20-30 |

**Governance Process Flow:**

1. **Proposers** submit funding requests through official Catalyst platform  
2. **Community Reviewers (LV0/LV1)** assess proposals using Impact, Feasibility, Value for Money criteria  
3. **Community Moderators (LV2)** verify review quality, approve/reject flagged reviews  
4. **Voters** make final funding decisions through capital-weighted voting  
5. **Catalyst Team** administers platform, calculates rewards, distributes funds

**Member Projects (38 Total):**

The Cardano Builder DAO consists of 38 member projects as stated in official communications [\[2\]](https://medium.com/@cardanobuilderdao/retrospective-governance-round-1-30fb9a30884c). Public evidence of active participation is [viewable on the Clarity Platform](https://www.clarity.vote/organizations/cardano/CardanoBuilderDAO/governance); some members did not submit funding proposals in Cycle 1 or do not have publicly observable governance artifacts. The complete verified member list with evidence categories is provided in Appendix A.

**Cycle 1 Funding Outcomes:**

- 27 member projects submitted funding proposals  
- 20 projects received funding (74.1% approval rate)  
- 7 projects were not funded (NEWM, Âtrium, Minswap, NMKR, XRAY, Big BLYMP, Begin Wallet)  
- Total distributed: ₳5,541,335 ($3.68M at $0.66336/ADA peg)

**Governance Process Flow:**

1. **Membership Diligence and Onboarding:** Projects go through a KYB and diligence process to confirm they meet the standards set forth in the governing documents.  
2. **Membership roster finalization:** The DAO must run governance actions to vote in or deny projects that do not satisfy all rules outlined in the governing documents, but do have products on Cardano that have KPIs to point to.  
3. **Member Projects** submit funding proposals through Clarity platform  
4. **Temperature Check Poll** requires 33% participation, majority approval  
5. **Board Members** provide governance oversight and strategic direction  
6. **Third-Party Assurance** verifies membership criteria compliance  
7. **Treasury Withdrawal Vote** requires 51% of all members (not just voters)  
8. **Smart Contracts** automatically execute approved treasury withdrawals  
9. **KPI Reporting** funded projects report metrics on public dashboard

### Intersect MBO Stakeholders

**Decision-Making Authority:**

| Stakeholder Group | Role | Decision Power | Count |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Steering Committee** | Strategic oversight | Budget approval | 13 verified |
| **Committee Chairs** | Domain expertise | Proposal development | 7 chairs |
| **Standing Committees** | Specialized governance | Domain-specific decisions | \~50-70 |
| **Board of Directors** | Legal oversight | Fiduciary duties | Board members |
| **Function Directors** | Operational leadership | Day-to-day operations | 5 directors |
| **Intersect Members** | Election voting | Committee elections | \~1,900 |
| **DReps** | Treasury approval | On-chain governance | Varies |
| **Constitutional Committee** | Constitutional compliance | Dual-approval | 7 members |

**Intersect Steering Committee:**

The claim that the Intersect Steering Committee has **16 voting members**, *as stated in the referenced report*, is maintained, but it is important to note that this number is **not fully verifiable through public documentation alone** [\[10\]](https://steeringcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/about/committee-members). While the overall structure is confirmed, **only 13 voting members can be independently verified** from public sources.

**Transparency Note:** Public documentation confirms 13 voting members. The discrepancy of 3 members arises from the Function Directors category. While the original report claims 5 voting Function Directors, public sources [\[10\]](https://steeringcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/about/committee-members) explicitly list 3 of the 5 director-level positions as non-voting. This may be due to **either** outdated documentation or a distinction between internal and public information.

### Cross-Mechanism Stakeholder Analysis

**Overlapping Stakeholders:**

Several stakeholders participate in multiple mechanisms:

1. **DReps:** Approve treasury allocations for both BuilderDAO (₳12M) and Intersect (₳264M); indirect influence on Catalyst through Voltaire integration  
2. **Constitutional Committee:** Dual-approval authority for BuilderDAO and Intersect treasury withdrawals  
3. **IOG/Intersect Administration:** Catalyst platform administration, Intersect governance, BuilderDAO administrative support  
4. **Community Members:** May participate as Catalyst voters, Intersect members, and BuilderDAO community supporters

**Stakeholder Contact References (Public):**

The following public references provide verifiable contact points for key stakeholder groups:

| **Constitutional Committee** | Cross-Mechanism | [constitution.gov.tools/committee](https://constitution.gov.tools/committee) | Governance Portal |

**Coordination Gaps:**

No joint coordination body exists between the three mechanisms. BuilderDAO maintains unilateral coordination rules.  Membership requires Catalyst proposal history, and the code of conduct prohibits funding the same scope of work funded elsewhere. However, no bilateral information sharing protocols or cross-mechanism review processes exist.

**Power Distribution Summary:**

| Mechanism | Primary Decision-Makers | Voting Model | Participation Rate | Verification Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Catalyst** | 175,000 ADA holders (Fund 14\) | Capital-weighted (1 ADA \= 1 vote) | Declining (7,900 unique wallets voted in F10; down from 364K total votes in F9) [\[12\]](https://medium.com/@cem.karaca/cardano-catalyst-when-decentralized-governance-becomes-plutocracy-cb726e21d697) [\[13\]](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/11/01/repositioning-project-catalyst-ahead-of-the-next-funding-round/) | Directionally verified (trend); magnitude estimates vary |
| **BuilderDAO** | 38 member projects | One-member-one-vote | 83% participation on funding votes [\[2\]](https://medium.com/@cardanobuilderdao/retrospective-governance-round-1-30fb9a30884c) | Verified |
| **Intersect** | 13 verified voting members (16 claimed) \+ 7 Committees | Committee \+ DRep/CC approval | 27% → 19.4% member turnout (Q1 → Q4 2025\) [\[14\]](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/intersect-committee-election-results) [\[15\]](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/intersect-committee-election-october-2025-results) | Verified (declining) |

**Methodological Note on Catalyst Participation:** Analysis of Catalyst participation is constrained by the lack of official longitudinal data comparing consistent metrics across all funds. Public data mixes asset-weighted metrics (total ADA) with identity-weighted metrics (unique wallets). Fund 10 data shows 7,900 unique wallets voted (out of 60,000 registered), representing 13.7% of circulating ADA [\[12\]](https://medium.com/@cem.karaca/cardano-catalyst-when-decentralized-governance-becomes-plutocracy-cb726e21d697). Fund 9 reported 364,000 "total votes cast" (different metric) [\[13\]](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/11/01/repositioning-project-catalyst-ahead-of-the-next-funding-round/). The observable trend is low and declining engagement, though precise percentage decline cannot be independently confirmed from authoritative sources.

## Mechanism Analysis

This section analyzes each mechanism using a consistent six-dimension evaluation framework: funds disbursed, mechanisms used, results achieved, critical findings, innovations introduced, and ecosystem impact.

### Project Catalyst

**Historical Context:**

Project Catalyst was launched in September 2020, dedicated to establishing decentralized governance and a self-sustaining ecosystem. Conceived as a series of experiments, its primary goal was to advance on-chain governance and accelerate community-driven innovation by creating a process for funding development directly from the Cardano treasury. The vision was to build a "self-sustaining engine of growth for Cardano's future" by empowering the community to propose, review, and vote on funding proposals.

Catalyst began with test funds, with Fund 0 as an internal trial and Fund 1 serving as a non-funding test event to refine the process. The first public funding round, Fund 2, commenced in early 2021\. By February 2021, just six months after inception, the initiative had attracted over 7,000 members to its IdeaScale platform and was described by IOG as the "world's largest decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)" at the time. Catalyst's development was iterative, with early funds managed through the IdeaScale platform and a separate mobile application for voting, later integrated more directly with Cardano wallets like Daedalus and Yoroi to improve user experience.

As the vanguard of Cardano's treasury system, Catalyst was designed to test and refine mechanisms for community-led funding, creating a space for early-stage ideas and innovations to receive seed funding. Its capital-weighted voting system (1 ADA \= 1 vote) and community-based review process established a foundational model for decentralized decision-making that would influence subsequent governance structures in the ecosystem.

**Overview:**

Project Catalyst operates as Cardano's community-driven innovation funding mechanism, having allocated $140.7 million USD equivalent across 2,222 proposals over 14 funding rounds from September 2020 to October 2025 [\[1\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/) [\[5\]](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds).

**Aggregate Statistics:**

| Metric | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Total Allocated** | $140.7M (₳204.6M \+ $38.4M) |
| **Projects Funded** | 2,222 |
| **Completion Rate** | 67.5% overall; 82.0% (F2-F9); 51.0% current (F10-F14) |
| **Average Allocation** | $63,316 per project |
| **Peak Participation** | 410,000 voters (Fund 10\) |
| **Recent Participation** | 175,000 voters (Fund 14), 57% decline |
| **Community Reviewers** | 8,118 total across all funds |
| **Countries Represented** | 114+ |

**Funding Evolution:**

Catalyst transitioned from USD denomination (Funds 2-9, $38.4M) to ADA denomination (Funds 10-14, ₳204.6M) in March 2024 [\[1\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bfnWFa94Y7Zj0G7dtpo9W1nAYGovJbswipxiHT4UE3g/).

| Era | Funds | Currency | Total | Projects | Completion |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **USD Era** | F2-F9 | USD | $38.4M | 1,142 | 82.0% |
| **ADA Era** | F10-F14 | ADA | ₳204.6M ($102.3M) | 1,080 | 51.0% current |

**Innovations:**

### BuilderDAO

**Historical Context:**

BuilderDAO was established in 2025 to address a funding gap identified within the Cardano ecosystem: the lack of sustained financial support for established, application-layer projects already live on mainnet and driving user activity. While Project Catalyst excelled at funding early-stage innovation, there was no dedicated mechanism to support the growth and operational needs of more mature dApps. This gap risked project stagnation and limited Cardano's broader adoption, as many builders struggled to achieve profitability due to the ecosystem's early stage of development.

The formal proposal for BuilderDAO was submitted to the community on April 27, 2025, and received a ₳12 million treasury allocation in mid-2025. The first cohort of members was approved in July 2025, with the inaugural governance and funding round taking place from August to September 2025\. This first round resulted in the distribution of over ₳5.5 million to 20 funded companies, selected from 27 applicants.

From its inception, BuilderDAO was designed with a distinct governance model to differentiate it from Catalyst. Key characteristics include one-member-one-vote governance ensuring merit-based decisions by builders themselves, membership criteria restricted to projects with functional mainnet applications and measurable traction, accountability through public KPI dashboards, a "depth over breadth" approach with fewer proposals allowing more thorough review, and treasury withdrawals executed automatically via on-chain smart contracts. BuilderDAO's mission is to "grow on-chain activity and adoption of Cardano" by providing temporary, catalytic support to help proven builders scale to profitability, bridging the gap between initial innovation and long-term sustainability.

**Overview:**

Cardano Builder DAO operates as a merit-based democratic funding mechanism for established projects, having secured ₳12M (\~$6M) through on-chain governance in August 2025 [\[3\]](https://www.1694.io/proposals/226) [\[2\]](https://medium.com/@cardanobuilderdao/retrospective-governance-round-1-30fb9a30884c).

### Intersect MBO

**Historical Context:**

Intersect was established in 2023 as a member-based organization (MBO) to facilitate community-led governance of Cardano following the ratification of the CIP-1694 governance framework. Its formation marked a transition in Cardano's evolution: the shift from centralized development and funding controlled by founding entities toward a decentralized, community-driven model. Intersect was designed to serve as a coordinating body that would enable the Cardano community to collectively manage the development roadmap, technical standards, and treasury allocation.

The organization's structure reflects the need for specialized expertise across Cardano's diverse operational domains. Intersect operates through seven primary committees, each focused on a specific area of governance and development: Budget Committee, Civics Committee, Membership and Community Committee, Open Source Committee, Product Committee, Technical Steering Committee, and Parameters Committee. These committees are staffed by elected community representatives and subject matter experts who review proposals, set standards, and make recommendations to the broader community.

Intersect's first major milestone was the coordination of Cardano's 2025 annual budget—the community-controlled budget allocation totaling ₳264 million. This budget process represented a shift in how Cardano's treasury would be managed, moving from ad-hoc funding decisions to a structured, transparent, and accountable annual planning cycle. The budget encompassed funding for core infrastructure development, ecosystem growth initiatives, community programs, and operational support for key service providers including Input Output Global (IOG), the Cardano Foundation, and Project Catalyst.

Intersect's governance model emphasizes transparency, accountability, and broad stakeholder participation. All committee meetings, proposals, and decisions are documented publicly, and the organization maintains detailed records of budget allocations, milestone achievements, and governance actions. This transparency is intended to build trust within the community and ensure that treasury funds are deployed effectively to advance Cardano's long-term strategic objectives.

**Overview:**

Intersect MBO coordinates Cardano's annual budget allocation through seven specialized committees. The 2025 budget of ₳264M represents Cardano's first community-controlled annual budget [\[4\]](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-budget-committee/archive/2025-cardano-budget-proposal-a-cardano-blockchain-ecosystem-budget).

## Goal Alignment Analysis

This section examines each mechanism's stated objectives and evaluates alignment between goals and actual funding patterns, drawing from official governance documents and funded project characteristics.

### Stated Objectives by Mechanism

**Project Catalyst Objectives:**

Based on official documentation [\[5\]](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds):

1. **Community-Driven Innovation:** Enable all ADA holders to participate in funding decisions  
2. **Early-Stage Experimentation:** Support unproven ideas and early-stage projects  
3. **Ecosystem Growth:** Fund projects that expand Cardano's capabilities and adoption  
4. **Decentralized Governance:** Demonstrate viability of community-controlled treasury allocation  
5. **Global Participation:** Enable worldwide participation in Cardano ecosystem development

**BuilderDAO Objectives:**

Based on governance proposal and retrospective [\[2\]](https://medium.com/@cardanobuilderdao/retrospective-governance-round-1-30fb9a30884c) [\[3\]](https://www.1694.io/proposals/226):

1. **Talent Retention:** Keep proven builders in Cardano ecosystem through competitive funding  
2. **Growth-Stage Support:** Provide operational funding for projects with live products and traction  
3. **Merit-Based Selection:** Fund projects based on demonstrated capability, not just ideas  
4. **On-Chain Activity:** Support projects driving measurable transactions, TVL, and user engagement  
5. **Ecosystem Stickiness:** Retain user assets on-chain through DeFi and infrastructure support

**Intersect MBO Objectives:**

Based on official documentation [\[4\]](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-budget-committee/archive/2025-cardano-budget-proposal-a-cardano-blockchain-ecosystem-budget) [\[6\]](https://www.intersectmbo.org):

1. **Core Infrastructure:** Fund protocol development, research, and technical infrastructure  
2. **Strategic Coordination:** Align ecosystem resources across specialized domains  
3. **Treasury Sustainability:** Ensure long-term treasury health through Net-Change-Limit framework  
4. **Decentralized Governance:** Transition from IOG control to community-governed budgeting  
5. **Accountability:** Achieve high completion rates through quarterly milestone verification

### Complementarity Assessment

**Strategic Alignment:**

The three mechanisms demonstrate strong complementarity across project lifecycle stages:

| Type | Mechanism | Objective Alignment | Avg Allocation | Focus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Innovation** | Catalyst | Early-stage experimentation, community innovation | $63,316 | Ideas → Prototypes |
| **Growth** | BuilderDAO | Talent retention, growth-stage support | $138,534 | Prototypes → Products |
| **Infrastructure** | Intersect | Core infrastructure, strategic coordination | $3,567,568 | Products → Ecosystem |

**Goal Coherence:**

The three mechanisms demonstrate coherence in several dimensions:

1. **Lifecycle:** Catalyst (Innovation) → BuilderDAO (growth) → Intersect (infrastructure) provides complete project lifecycle support  
2. **Risk Distribution:** Catalyst accepts high risk for innovation; BuilderDAO focuses on proven builders; Intersect prioritizes stable infrastructure  
3. **Governance Diversity:** Three distinct voting models (capital-weighted, democratic, committee) enable experimentation

**Alignment Confirmation:**

The three mechanisms demonstrate confirmed strategic alignment across their primary objectives: Catalyst serves early-stage innovation, BuilderDAO serves growth-stage builders, and Intersect serves core infrastructure.

**Alignment Gaps Requiring Coordination:**

While objectives align in theory, operational coordination is absent. The mechanisms pursue complementary goals independently rather than collaboratively. This creates the coordination gaps documented in the following section, where strategic alignment exists at the objective level but not at the execution level.  
---

## Observations and Considerations

This section identifies structural patterns, coordination gaps, and systemic challenges that emerge from cross-mechanism analysis, with specific evidence and quantified impacts where available.

### 1\. Independent Operation

**Description:**

The three funding mechanisms lack a joint coordination structure. BuilderDAO's governing documents establish unilateral linkages to Catalyst (membership prerequisites require Catalyst proposal history; code of conduct prohibits double-dipping.

**Evidence:**

- No ecosystem-wide funding strategy document exists  
- No cross-mechanism coordination committee or liaison roles  
- BuilderDAO Cycle 1 funded several projects previously funded by Catalyst  
- Intersect's ₳64.3M Catalyst 2025 allocation made without Catalyst governance input  
- No unified reporting on total ecosystem funding or strategic priorities

**Specific Coordination Gap Instances:**

1. **Cross-Mechanism Funding Patterns:** Multiple BuilderDAO-funded projects (including SundaeSwap, Handle, Clarity, Indigo) have received prior Catalyst funding. BuilderDAO's code of conduct prohibits funding the same scope of work, but no cross-mechanism review process systematically verifies scope differentiation. The absence of unified project tracking prevents analysis of whether sequential funding represents strategic progression or potential overlap.

2. **Independent Strategic Evolution:** Each mechanism has independently evolved governance innovations (Catalyst's DRep integration, BuilderDAO's KPI dashboard, Intersect's Net-Change-Limit framework) without formal knowledge sharing or adoption consideration. Innovations remain siloed rather than propagating across the ecosystem.

**Impact:**

- **Duplication Risk:** Projects may receive funding from multiple mechanisms for similar work  
- **Strategic Misalignment:** Mechanisms may fund competing or redundant initiatives  
- **Inefficient Resource Allocation:** Lack of coordination prevents strategic portfolio management  
- **Missed Synergies:** Opportunities for cross-mechanism collaboration not identified or pursued

**Specific Coordination Improvements Suggested:**

1. **Develop an Ecosystem Funding Coordination Committee:**  
- Membership: Catalyst representatives, BuilderDAO representatives, Intersect representatives, Prominent DReps, and a Constitutional Committee member  
- Mandate: Strategic coordination, gap identification, duplication prevention  
- Meetings: At minimum quarterly coordination with public minutes  
- Deliverables: Annual ecosystem funding strategy, cross-mechanism KPI framework  
2. **Liaison Roles:**  
- Designate liaison representatives from each mechanism to attend other mechanisms' governance meetings  
- Facilitate information sharing on funded projects, strategic priorities, and governance innovations  
- Report coordination opportunities and potential conflicts to respective governance bodies  
3. **Strategic Planning Process:**  
- Annual ecosystem funding strategy developed collaboratively across all three mechanisms  
- Define complementary roles and funding priorities for each mechanism  
- Identify funding gaps and redundancies  
- Establish shared success metrics for ecosystem-wide impact

### 2\. Separate Tracking Systems

**Description:**

No unified project database exists across the three mechanisms, preventing tracking of projects, funding history, and outcomes.

**Evidence:**

- Catalyst Public Reporting Tracker only covers Catalyst projects  
- BuilderDAO KPI dashboard only tracks BuilderDAO projects  
- Intersect budget documentation only covers Intersect programs  
- No cross-mechanism project identifier or unified tracking system  
- Projects may appear in multiple mechanisms without linkage

**Impact:**

- **Duplication Undetected:** Projects receiving funding from multiple mechanisms not systematically identified  
- **Strategic Progression Invisible:** Cannot track projects progressing from Catalyst → BuilderDAO → Intersect  
- **Ecosystem Impact Unmeasured:** Total ecosystem funding per project unknown  
- **Accountability Gaps:** Projects failing in one mechanism may receive funding in another without visibility

**Data Sharing Improvements Suggested:**

1. **Unified Project Database:**  
- Centralized registry of all Cardano treasury-funded projects across all mechanisms  
- Unique project identifier linking projects across mechanisms  
- Funding history tracking: total allocated, source mechanisms, completion status  
- Unified KPI framework: standardized metrics across all mechanisms  
- Public transparency: Open-access dashboard for community oversight  
2. **Data Integration Protocol:**  
- Automated data synchronization on project funding, milestones, and outcomes  
- Privacy-preserving architecture: Public data shared, sensitive data protected  
- Data quality standards: Mandatory reporting requirements across all mechanisms  
3. **Cross-Mechanism Analytics:**  
- Ecosystem-wide views showing funding, completion, and geographic distribution  
- Project progression tracking: Identify projects moving through lifecycle stages  
- Duplication detection: Flag projects receiving funding from multiple mechanisms

### 3\. Distinct Strategic Approaches

**Description:**

No ecosystem-wide funding strategy exists defining complementary roles, priorities, and success metrics for the three mechanisms.

**Evidence:**

- Each mechanism operates with independent objectives and governance  
- No formal goal alignment document confirming complementary roles  
- Strategic decisions made independently  
- Funding priorities may overlap or conflict without coordination  
- No shared definition of ecosystem success or strategic priorities

**Impact:**

- **Resource Inefficiency:** Mechanisms may fund similar initiatives without awareness  
- **Strategic Drift:** Independent evolution may reduce complementarity over time  
- **Unclear Value Proposition:** Projects uncertain which mechanism fits their stage and needs

**Goal Alignment Verification:**

The complementary roles described above were confirmed through direct stakeholder interviews:

- **Catalyst Role (Seed/Innovation):** Confirmed by Kris Baird on Dec 19, 2025\.  
- **BuilderDAO Role (Growth/Mature):** Confirmed by Logan Panchot on Dec 17, 2025\.  
- **Intersect Role (Infrastructure):** Confirmed by Alex Maaza on Dec 18, 2025\.

*Note: While stakeholders confirmed these are the intended roles, they acknowledged that formal documentation and coordination mechanisms are currently absent.*

**Specific Strategic Alignment Improvements Needed:**

1. **Ecosystem Funding Strategy Document:**  
- Formal document defining complementary roles for each mechanism  
- Clear delineation: Catalyst (seed-stage), BuilderDAO (growth-stage), Intersect (infrastructure)  
- Funding priorities aligned with Cardano Constitution and ecosystem roadmap  
- Success metrics defined for each mechanism and ecosystem overall  
- Annual review and update process involving all three mechanisms  
2. **Goal Alignment Framework:**  
- Explicit mapping of mechanism objectives to ecosystem priorities  
- Identification of overlaps and complementarities  
- Conflict resolution process for competing priorities  
- Shared accountability for ecosystem-wide outcomes  
3. **Strategic Portfolio Management:**  
- Ecosystem-wide view of funding allocation across stages, domains, and geographies  
- Portfolio balancing: Ensure appropriate distribution across innovation, growth, infrastructure  
- Risk management: Diversify funding across project types and risk profiles  
- Gap identification: Systematically identify and address funding gaps

### 4\. Completion Rate Variation

**Description:**

Completion rates vary across mechanisms: 67.5% (Catalyst), pending (BuilderDAO), and 96% quarterly milestone completion (Intersect). Multiple factors may contribute to this variation.

**Evidence:**

- Catalyst completion rate: 67.5% overall (82% F2-F9, 51% current F10-F14)  
- BuilderDAO completion rate: Pending (Cycle 1 projects still in progress)  
- Intersect completion rate: 96% (quarterly milestones)  
- Catalyst data quality: 48.6% unaccounted projects in F10-F14 vs. 0.1% in F2-F9

**Confounding Variables:**

The completion rate variation may reflect multiple factors beyond payment structure:

- **Project Maturity:** Intersect primarily funds established institutions (IOG, Catalyst operations), while Catalyst funds individuals and early-stage projects  
- **Team Professionalism:** Intersect recipients are professional organizations; Catalyst includes many first-time proposers  
- **Grant Size:** Larger grants may correlate with more professional teams than smaller grants  
- **Selection Rigor:** Intersect's committee review vs. Catalyst's community voting may select for different risk profiles

These confounding factors make direct causation claims between payment structure and completion rates unsupported.

**Observations:**

- Projects face different accountability requirements depending on mechanism  
- 527 Catalyst projects (23.7%) lack final outcome data (this may be due to these projects still being in progress).

**Specific Accountability Improvements Needed:**

1. **Milestone-Based Payment Adoption:**  
- Implement quarterly milestone verification for Catalyst projects  
- Holdback provisions: Retain 10-20% of funds until project completion  
- Smart contract escrow: Automate milestone-based releases (similar to BuilderDAO)  
- Graduated approach: Smaller projects (\<₳50,000) may retain upfront payment for simplicity  
2. **Mandatory Final Reporting:**  
- All projects must submit completion report within 30 days of project end date  
- Automated reminders for overdue reports  
- Future eligibility: Projects failing to submit final reports ineligible for future funding  
- Community verification: Random sampling of completed projects for outcome validation  
3. **Unified KPI Framework:**  
- Public dashboards for all mechanisms (Catalyst, BuilderDAO, Intersect)  
- Transparent outcome tracking enables community oversight and accountability  
- Performance-based funding: Prior completion record influences future funding eligibility

### 5\. Geographic Concentration

**Description:**

All three mechanisms show a significant portion of funding allocation to Western regions (North America \+ Europe).

**Evidence:**

- Catalyst: 73% North America/Europe (Fund 2-9 data)  
- BuilderDAO: \~65% North America/Europe (estimated from member list)  
- Intersect: \~85% North America/Europe (IOG and committee concentration)  
- Underrepresented regions: Asia (14%), South America (7%), Africa (3%)  
- Language barriers: Proposals and voting primarily in English

**Critical Clarification \- Application Bias vs. Approval Bias:**

The observed geographic concentration **does not indicate discriminatory approval processes**. Available data does not distinguish between:

- **Application bias:** Fewer proposals submitted from non-Western regions  
- **Approval bias:** Non-Western proposals rejected at higher rates

Without proposal submission data by region, the 70-75% Western concentration may simply reflect who applies, not approval discrimination. All three mechanisms use merit-based selection criteria without geographic quotas.

**Observations:**

- 70-75% of funding allocated to North America and Europe across all mechanisms  
- Asia (14%), South America (7%), Africa (3%) receive smaller allocations  
- Proposals and voting interfaces primarily in English  
- **No data available** on proposal submission rates by region  
- **No evidence** of approval bias against non-Western proposals  
- Concentration may reflect application patterns, language barriers, or ecosystem awareness rather than selection bias

**Values Choice, Not Efficiency Imperative:**

Geographic diversification is a **normative preference** (reflecting values about global inclusion), not an objective efficiency requirement. Different stakeholders may hold different views:

- **Pro-diversification view:** Global participation strengthens ecosystem resilience, expands market reach, and aligns with decentralization values  
- **Merit-focused view:** Geographic origin is irrelevant; funding should flow to highest-quality proposals regardless of location  
- **Market-driven view:** Concentration in regions with strong technical talent and infrastructure is economically rational

None of these perspectives is objectively correct. The choice to pursue geographic diversification reflects community values, not technical optimization.

**Considerations (If Geographic Diversification Is Valued by Stakeholders):**

1. **Regional Programs:** Dedicated challenges for specific regions, with regional ambassadors for proposal support  
2. **Language Support:** Translation services for proposals and voting interfaces in major languages  
3. **Time Zone Accommodations:** Asynchronous participation options and regionally-scheduled events

**Trade-offs:**

- Regional programs may increase participation but could reduce average proposal quality if selection standards are lowered  
- Translation costs may not yield proportional increases in high-quality proposals  
- No evidence currently available that qualified non-Western proposals are being rejected; concentration may reflect application patterns

### 6\. Funding Range Observations

**Description:**

The three mechanisms cover different funding ranges: Catalyst averages $63K, BuilderDAO $139K, and Intersect $3.57M. Smaller (\<$10K) and mid-range ($500K-$2M) allocations are less common.

**Evidence:**

- Catalyst average: $63,316 (may be too large for small experiments)  
- BuilderDAO average: $138,534 (growth-stage)  
- Intersect average: $3,567,568 (infrastructure-scale)  
- Gap 1: \<$10K micro-grants not systematically addressed  
- Gap 2: $500K-$2M scale-up funding between BuilderDAO and Intersect

**Observations:**

- Fund 2's $535 message signing standard demonstrates potential value of micro-grants  
- No systematic micro-grant program (\<$10K) currently exists  
- $500K-$2M range between BuilderDAO ($139K avg) and Intersect ($3.57M avg) has fewer allocations  
- No data available on how many qualified projects at these scales have been rejected or sought funding elsewhere

**Considerations (If Additional Funding Ranges Are Desired):**

1. **Micro-Grant Program (\<$10K):** Rapid-cycle funding for small experiments and technical standards  
2. **Scale-Up Program ($500K-$2M):** Mid-range funding for projects between BuilderDAO and Intersect scales

**Trade-offs:**

- Micro-grants may generate high volume but require administrative overhead  
- Scale-up program may address a gap, or projects at this scale may appropriately seek traditional VC funding  
- No evidence that qualified projects at these scales are currently being turned away  
- Administrative costs for new programs reduce funds available for direct project allocation

## Considerations for Discussion

This section presents actionable considerations for addressing identified gaps, structured as options with implementation approaches, trade-offs, and resource requirements.

### Overview

Based on the observations documented above, this section presents potential approaches for ecosystem coordination. Each consideration includes implementation options, trade-offs, and estimated costs. These are presented as options for community discussion, not prescriptive requirements.

### Consideration 1: Ecosystem Funding Coordination Structure

**Potential Approach:**

Establish formal coordination structure with representatives from all three funding mechanisms to enable information sharing and strategic alignment.

**Limitation \- Non-Powers Clause:**

The coordination body would have **no veto authority, no approval power, and no binding authority** over any mechanism. Each mechanism retains complete sovereignty over its funding decisions, governance processes, and strategic direction. The coordination body serves as an **information-sharing forum and strategic alignment facilitator only**.

**Sovereignty Preservation:**

- **Catalyst:** Retains full autonomy over proposal selection, voting processes, and fund allocation  
- **BuilderDAO:** Retains full autonomy over member voting, project selection, and governance decisions  
- **Intersect:** Retains full autonomy over budget allocation, committee operations, and strategic priorities  
- **Coordination Body Role:** Advisory only—publishes ecosystem funding strategy, identifies gaps/overlaps, facilitates information sharing

**Cardano-Specific Rationale:**

Cardano's constitutional governance model creates both the authority and the procedural pathway for this committee through DRep ratification. Unlike informal coordination attempts in other ecosystems, a formally constituted committee could carry governance weight through Intersect's existing committee infrastructure. The Cardano Constitution provides the legal framework for cross-mechanism coordination that most treasuries lack.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Coordination Benefits:** Reduces duplication risk, enables strategic alignment, facilitates knowledge sharing  
- **Coordination Costs:** Administrative overhead, potential bureaucratic delays, committee member time commitment  
- **Alternative:** Mechanisms could continue operating independently, relying on informal coordination and market forces  
- **Risk:** Formal coordination may slow decision-making or create single point of failure

**Anticipated Political Objections:**

1. **"This recentralizes governance"** → Response: No binding authority; purely advisory  
2. **"This creates another gatekeeper"** → Response: No veto or approval power; mechanisms retain full autonomy  
3. **"This overlaps with Intersect's mandate"** → Response: Intersect is one participant; coordination body covers all three mechanisms

**Voluntary Participation Framework:**

Each mechanism may choose to participate or withdraw at any time. Coordination body recommendations are non-binding. Mechanisms may adopt, modify, or reject any coordination body outputs without consequence.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Committee Formation (Month 1-2):**  
- Designate 2 representatives from Catalyst (1 IOG/Intersect admin, 1 Community Advisor)  
- Designate 2 representatives from BuilderDAO (1 Board member, 1 member project)  
- Designate 3 representatives from Intersect (1 Steering Committee, 1 Budget Committee, 1 Technical Committee)  
- Designate 2 DRep representatives (elected by DRep community)  
- Designate 1 Constitutional Committee representative  
- **Total: 10 members**  
2. **Mandate Definition (Month 2-3):**  
- **Advisory Functions Only:**  
  - Strategic coordination across funding mechanisms (non-binding recommendations)  
  - Gap identification and duplication prevention (informational only)  
  - Cross-mechanism information sharing (facilitation, not control)  
  - Annual ecosystem funding strategy development (advisory document)  
  - Conflict resolution for competing priorities (mediation, not arbitration)  
- **Explicitly Prohibited:**  
  - Veto authority over any mechanism's decisions  
  - Approval requirements for funding allocations  
  - Binding mandates or requirements on any mechanism  
  - Budget control or reallocation authority  
3. **Operational Framework (Month 3-4):**  
- Quarterly coordination meetings (public minutes)  
- Annual ecosystem funding strategy document  
- Cross-mechanism KPI framework development  
- Liaison roles for ongoing communication  
- Public reporting on coordination activities  
4. **First Deliverables (Month 4-6):**  
- Ecosystem funding strategy document (Year 1\)  
- Unified project database requirements  
- Cross-mechanism KPI framework  
- Coordination improvement roadmap

**Success Criteria:**

- Committee formed and operational within 6 months  
- Annual ecosystem funding strategy published  
- Cross-mechanism coordination meetings held quarterly with \>80% attendance  
- Duplication incidents identified and resolved  
- Stakeholder satisfaction survey: \>70% positive feedback on coordination

### Consideration 2: Implement Unified Project Tracking Database

**Objective:**

Create centralized registry of all Cardano treasury-funded projects across all mechanisms to prevent duplication, enable strategic progression tracking, and measure ecosystem-wide impact.

**Implementation Questions:**

This proposal sits at the boundary of governance, operations, and data infrastructure. The following questions require explicit decisions before implementation:

1. **Ownership & Maintenance:**  
- Who or what entity would own and maintain this database?  
- Options include: Intersect MBO, Catalyst administration, independent third party, decentralized infrastructure, or other  
- This decision determines accountability, funding source, and governance authority  
    
2. **Participation Model:**  
- Would participation be mandatory or opt-in for each mechanism?  
- Mandatory: Requires governance authority to compel participation  
- Opt-in: Relies on voluntary adoption, may result in incomplete data  
- This decision determines data completeness and governance implications  
    
3. **Authority Level:**  
- Would this be the authoritative source of truth or informational aggregation?  
- Authoritative: Mechanisms must defer to database records (governance implications)  
- Informational: Database reflects mechanism data without override authority (operational tool)  
- This decision determines whether the database has governance power or serves as a neutral tool

**Note:** These questions are presented without recommendations to enable stakeholder discussion. Different answers create different systems with different governance implications.

**Cardano-Specific Rationale:**

Cardano's on-chain governance infrastructure enables verifiable project tracking through treasury withdrawal transactions. Unlike ecosystems relying on off-chain databases, Cardano can link project funding to on-chain governance actions, creating an auditable trail from proposal to disbursement. This technical capability positions Cardano to implement unified tracking with higher transparency than most treasuries.

**Governance vs. Operations Boundary:**

The unified database could function as:

- **Operational Tool:** Neutral aggregator of mechanism data with no governance authority  
- **Governance Infrastructure:** Authoritative registry with binding implications for funding decisions

This distinction determines whether the database is a coordination tool or a governance layer. Stakeholders may have different preferences based on their views of mechanism sovereignty.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Requirements Definition (Month 1-2):**  
- Define data schema: project identifier, funding history, mechanism source, completion status  
- Define KPI framework: standardized metrics across all mechanisms  
- Define privacy requirements: public data vs. sensitive data protection  
2. **System Development (Month 3-6):**  
- Build centralized database with integration capabilities  
- Develop public-facing dashboard for community transparency  
- Implement automated data synchronization from all three mechanisms  
- Build analytics capabilities: duplication detection, progression tracking, impact measurement  
3. **Data Migration (Month 7-8):**  
- Migrate Catalyst Public Reporting Tracker data (2,222 projects)  
- Migrate BuilderDAO KPI dashboard data (20 Cycle 1 projects)  
- Migrate Intersect budget documentation (37 programs)  
- Establish unique project identifiers and cross-mechanism linkages  
4. **Launch and Adoption (Month 9-10):**  
- Public launch of unified dashboard  
- Training for mechanism administrators on data entry and synchronization  
- Community education on dashboard usage and interpretation  
- Feedback collection and iterative improvements

**Success Criteria:**

- 100% of projects from all three mechanisms registered in unified database  
- Public dashboard launched  
- Duplication detection: \>90% of cross-mechanism funding identified  
- Data quality: \<5% missing or incomplete project records

### Consideration 3: Develop Regional Funding Programs

**Objective:**

Increase non-Western participation from 25% to 40-50% through dedicated regional challenges, language support, and local ambassadors.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Regional Challenge Design (Month 1-3):**  
- Create dedicated challenges for Asia, South America, Africa regions  
- Allocate funding annually across regional challenges  
- Define regional criteria recognizing local market conditions and cost structures  
- Recruit regional ambassadors to support proposal development  
2. **Language Support Implementation (Month 4-6):**  
- Translation services for proposals  
- Multilingual voting interfaces and governance documentation  
- Bilingual community advisors and reviewers  
3. **Regional Community Hubs (Month 7-12):**  
- Establish community hubs  
- Local events, workshops, and proposal development support  
- Time zone accommodations: Asynchronous governance participation options  
- Recorded sessions with multilingual subtitles

**Success Criteria:**

- Non-Western participation increases from 25% to 40-50% within 24 months  
- Regional challenges receive \>200 proposals per fund  
- Language support: \>30% of proposals submitted in non-English languages  
- Regional ambassador network: \>20 active ambassadors across 6+ regions  
- Community satisfaction: \>70% positive feedback from non-Western participants

### Consideration 4: Create Micro-Grant and Scale-Up Programs

**Objective:**

Address funding gaps at \<$10K (micro-grants) and $500K-$2M (scale-up) to provide complete lifecycle coverage from ideation to infrastructure.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Micro-Grant Program Design (Month 1-3):**  
- Target: Technical standards, community tools, small experiments (\<$10K)  
- Rapid approval: 2-week cycles with streamlined application (1-2 pages)  
- Minimal governance: Small review committee (5-7 members) with rotating membership  
- Simplified reporting: Final report only, no milestone requirements  
2. **Scale-Up Program Design (Month 1-3):**  
- Target: Projects graduating from BuilderDAO or Catalyst seeking infrastructure funding ($500K-$2M)  
- Annual allocation: ₳20M (\~$10M) supporting 5-15 projects  
- Rigorous due diligence: Committee review, technical assessment, market validation, team evaluation  
- Quarterly milestones: Milestone-based payment structure  
- Performance-based: Prior completion record required for eligibility  
3. **Pilot Programs (Month 4-9):**  
- Micro-grant pilot: 50 projects, $5K average, 2-week approval cycles  
- Scale-up pilot: 3 projects, $1M average, quarterly milestones  
- Evaluation: Completion rates, impact assessment, process efficiency  
- Refinement: Adjust criteria, processes based on pilot results  
4. **Full Launch (Month 10-12):**  
- Public announcement and community education  
- Application portals and review processes operational  
- Integration with unified project database  
- Quarterly reporting on program outcomes

**Success Criteria:**

- Micro-grant program: 200+ projects funded annually, \>85% completion rate  
- Scale-up program: 5-15 projects funded annually, \>90% completion rate  
- Lifecycle progression: \>20% of micro-grant projects progress to Catalyst

### Consideration 5: Establish Formal Goal Alignment Framework

**Objective:**

Create formal ecosystem funding strategy document defining complementary roles, priorities, and success metrics for all three mechanisms.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Strategy Development (Month 1-4):**  
- Facilitated workshops with representatives from all three mechanisms  
- Define complementary roles: Catalyst, BuilderDAO, Intersect  
- Identify priorities aligned with Cardano Constitution and ecosystem roadmap  
- Define success metrics for each mechanism and ecosystem overall  
- Develop conflict resolution process for competing priorities  
2. **Community Consultation (Month 5-6):**  
- Public draft released for community feedback  
- Town halls and forum discussions to gather input  
- Refinement based on community feedback  
- Approval by governance bodies of all three mechanisms  
3. **Implementation (Month 7-9):**  
- Formal adoption by Catalyst, BuilderDAO, Intersect governance  
- Integration into funding processes and decision criteria  
- Training for reviewers, committee members, and community on alignment

## Conclusion

This assessment examines Cardano's funding ecosystem across financial flows, governance structures, stakeholder participation, process workflows, goal alignment, and coordination.

**Strengths:**

1. **Lifecycle Coverage:** Three mechanisms provide funding across project stages from seed to growth to infrastructure  
2. **Governance Diversity:** Three distinct voting models (capital-weighted, democratic, committee) enable experimentation and learning  
3. **Scale:** $278.7M allocated positions Cardano among ecosystems with treasury-funded development  
4. **Transparency:** Public reporting of funded projects and outcomes exceeds standards in many traditional grant programs  
5. **Strategic Complementarity:** Mechanisms demonstrate natural alignment across innovation, talent retention, and infrastructure objectives

**Gaps:**

1. **Coordination Gap:** No joint coordination body for strategic alignment or information sharing; BuilderDAO maintains unilateral anti-duplication rules but no reciprocal measures exist.  
2. **Data Sharing Gap:** No unified project database; projects may receive funding from multiple mechanisms without visibility  
3. **Strategic Alignment Gap:** No ecosystem-wide funding strategy defining complementary roles and priorities  
4. **Accountability Variation:** Completion rates vary across mechanisms (67.5% Catalyst vs. 96% Intersect quarterly milestones), with multiple contributing factors including payment structure, project maturity, and selection rigor  
5. **Geographic Gap:** 75% Western concentration limits global ecosystem development

### Stakeholder Mapping Insights

This assessment identifies 4,000+ stakeholders across three mechanisms:

- **Catalyst:** 175,000 voters, 3,500+ community reviewers, 1,600+ proposers per fund  
- **BuilderDAO:** 38 member projects, 5 board members, third-party assurance provider  
- **Intersect:** 13 verified voting Steering Committee members (16 claimed), \~70 committee members, \~1,900 Intersect members, DReps, Constitutional Committee

No formal coordination exists between these stakeholder groups, creating potential for strategic misalignment and inefficient resource allocation.

### Process Documentation Insights

The three mechanisms employ distinct governance processes:

- **Catalyst:** Community-driven (proposal → review → vote → fund → report) with capital-weighted voting  
- **BuilderDAO:** Merit-based democratic (membership → proposal → temperature check → vote → fund → KPI tracking) with one-member-one-vote  
- **Intersect:** Committee-coordinated (committee proposal → budget review → steering approval → DRep/CC → quarterly milestones) with dual approval

These processes demonstrate complementarity but lack integration or coordination protocols.

### Goal Alignment Insights

The three mechanisms demonstrate strong objective alignment across project lifecycle stages:

- **Catalyst:** Community innovation, early-stage experimentation, global participation  
- **BuilderDAO:** Talent retention, growth-stage support, on-chain activity  
- **Intersect:** Core infrastructure, strategic coordination, treasury sustainability

However, no formal goal alignment document exists confirming complementary roles or defining success metrics for ecosystem-wide impact.

### Final Assessment

Cardano's funding ecosystem demonstrates achievement in decentralized governance, having allocated $278.7 million across 2,279 projects through three complementary mechanisms. The ecosystem's strengths in lifecycle coverage, governance diversity, and strategic complementarity provide a strong foundation for continued growth.

However, gaps in coordination, data sharing, and accountability limit the ecosystem's potential impact. The seven recommendations in this assessment provide a roadmap for addressing these gaps through formal coordination structures, unified data systems, improved accountability mechanisms, and strategic alignment frameworks.

The Cardano funding ecosystem has the potential to serve as a model for decentralized governance in ecosystems. Addressing the identified gaps through systematic coordination improvements positions Cardano to maximize the impact of its treasury resources and achieve its vision of global adoption.

## Appendix A: BuilderDAO Member Projects Verification

Transparency and verifiability are core principles of this assessment. This appendix provides detailed, project-level verification of all 38 BuilderDAO member projects, documenting the evidence basis for each membership claim. Unlike Project Catalyst, which maintains public databases of all funded projects, BuilderDAO's membership roster and funding decisions are documented across multiple sources including governance retrospectives, Clarity platform proposals, and community reports. This appendix consolidates that information into a single, verifiable reference.

The verification methodology employs a three-tier evidence categorization system that distinguishes between projects with direct funding evidence (Category A), established projects referenced in official materials (Category B), and projects whose membership is asserted but lacks independent verification (Category C). This tiered approach provides readers with clear signals about the strength of evidence supporting each membership claim, enabling informed interpretation of BuilderDAO's composition and decision-making patterns. All evidence is linked to publicly accessible sources, allowing independent verification of the findings presented in the main report.

### Verification Methodology

This appendix provides project-level verification of the 38 BuilderDAO member projects. Public evidence of active participation varies by project; membership is verified at the entity level via official BuilderDAO communications [\[2\]](https://medium.com/@cardanobuilderdao/retrospective-governance-round-1-30fb9a30884c), while project-level participation is verified where public governance artifacts exist.

**Evidence Categories:**

- **Category A (Direct Funding Evidence):** Projects confirmed through Cycle 1 funding outcomes, Clarity governance proposals, or explicit mention in funding reports [\[8\]](https://medium.com/tap-in-with-taptools/cb-dao-projects-funded-c0b3d3bd531f)  
- **Category B (Established Projects):** Prominent Cardano ecosystem projects referenced in BuilderDAO materials but without observable Cycle 1 funding proposals  
- **Category C (Membership Asserted):** Projects whose membership is stated in official BuilderDAO communications but lack independent verification through Cycle 1 governance artifacts

### Category A: Direct Funding Evidence (20 Projects)

These projects received funding in Governance Round 1 and/or have publicly observable Clarity governance proposals [\[8\]](https://medium.com/tap-in-with-taptools/cb-dao-projects-funded-c0b3d3bd531f).
